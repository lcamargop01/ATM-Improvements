# ATM-Improvements
## Project Description
A browser-based simulation ATM that allows for deposits and withdrawals. This will allow users to use the same submit form, but they can indicate whether they are depositing or withdrawing money based on the button they select

## How To Run
(1) Download all files from the master branch of this repository into a directory on your local machine 
<ul>
  <li> account1.jsx </li>
  <li> atm-improvements.jsx </li>
  <li> package1.json </li>
  <li> solution.jsx </li>
  <li> index.html </li>
  <li> styles.css </li>
</ul>
(2) Open index.html in browser (Google Chrome provides best results)

## Roadmap
The next improvement I plan to be working on is for the simulation to be less empty - potentially add images in the background, moving features.
